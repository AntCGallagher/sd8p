\section*{Appendix X - Git Setup}
To use Group's 8 code base, first you have to clone the GitHub repository. Assuming you are on a DICE machine, follow the instructions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open a Terminal window.
  \item Use the \textbf{cd} command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the \textbf{pwd} to see which directory you are in.
  \item Once in the right directory use the command: \\ \\ \textbf{git clone https://github.com/AntCGallagher/sd8p.git}
  \item Once the command is finished, you should have a directory named \textbf{sd8p} with the code base.
\end{enumerate}

To test that the code is executable use the command \textbf{cd} to enter the sd8p directory and try and run the command: \\
\begin{center}
\textbf{python visionwrapper.py \textit{roomNumber}} 
\end{center}

The argument roomNumber is either 1 or 0 depending on which room you are in. You should now see the camera feed and some robots detected if they are in the field!
