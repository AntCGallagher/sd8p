Communication is key when undertaking a project of this size. At the first meeting it was decided that we would meet at least once a week to discuss how everyone is coming along in their roles. We set up the communication channels as such:

\subparagraph{Facebook Messenger}
Most of our information would be sent through the Facebook Messenger. It is by far the most convenient channel of communication and the one that people check the most (so any messages sent here would be hard to miss). We also communicate with the other group through this channel of communication.
\subparagraph{Slack}
Any formal communications between groups, questions to the mentors or talking to our own mentor would be done through Slack. Slack is the only platform where all the participants/organizers of SDP are, so any questions regarding SDP would be posted there.
\subparagraph{Asana}
Although Facebook Messenger was our primary communications channel, we still used Asana to monitor and track some goals. Each group had their own agenda leading up to the different deadlines and each member could check Asana to see what another group is up to.
\subparagraph{Team Meetings}
Generally whenever a team had to work on certain tasks they would meet together. In these meetings they would work together in their daily goals and would share information between the present members of the team.
