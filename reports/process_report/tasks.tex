The first order of business was to split this colossal task of getting a robot to play football into a smaller subset of tasks. As a team, there was a discussion to determine what different tasks there were and, following that discussion, five main tasks were created. The group then proceeded to split the tasks by simply asking who wanted to do which task. The teams originally assigned to each task were as follow:

\subparagraph{Team Manager}
Andra took the role of lead Team Manager while Filipe would help in anything that was needed. The Team Managers would be responsible for ensuring appropriate communication with the mentor. Examples of other task that were part of the Team Managers responsibilities are: organizing weekly meetings, making sure everyone is doing an equal amount of work and keeping track of everyone's work.


\subparagraph{Vision}
Alex and Vesko both volunteered to do the Vision part of the assignment. The Vision team would be responsible for building a world model using the camera feed and passing that to the Strategy team. Examples of tasks that the Vision team had to accomplish for are: calibrating the camera feed from the pitch rooms, manipulating the images coming from the camera feed and analysing the processed data from the camera feed.

\subparagraph{Strategy}
Danial and Filipe decided to do the Strategy part of the assignment. The Strategy team would be responsible for building a strategy that the robot can use during friendlies and the final day. Examples of tasks that the Strategy team would have to do are: communicating with the different teams to understand how each part of the project is going on, developing a strategy for the robot and coordinating with the other group to further progress both robots.

\subparagraph{Communications}
Anthony chose to do the Communications part of the assignment. The Communications team would be responsible for transferring messages between the computer and the Arduino using the RF stick. This task involved many smaller task such as: testing the RF stick, implementing a protocol to send/receive messages and ensuring the messages are being processed correctly on the robot.

\subparagraph{Hardware}
Andra, Lazar and Stefani decided to do the Hardware part of the assignment. The Hardware team would be responsible to design and build the robot. They would also have to: implement the different instructions that the robot would have to follow, think of a kicker/grabber mechanism and find the needed parts to build the robot.

There have been no movements between teams but Stefani is no longer taking SDP so the hardware team has been reduced to two members. At many times during the project the different teams also help each other in their respective parts (so no singular team is working only with themselves).
