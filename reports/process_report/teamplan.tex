There were some initial communications between the two groups from Team D to try and determine how we should approach the project as a whole. It was first decided that each group should act independently (while sharing information where appropriate) until the second friendly match, where thereafter we would reformulate our plans and strategy for the future matches. From the initial communications both groups settled on using the Python codebase from previous year. After the first friendly match, both vision subgroups from each group decided that it would better to work together to work on improving the current vision system.
