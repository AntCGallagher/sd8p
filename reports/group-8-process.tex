\section{Conclusion}
In face of such a large task the group has kept itself on track in an organized, and relaxed, fashion. Expectations were high for the first friendly, but due to several different factors the robot did not perform as expected. We are currently awaiting to see the results for the second friendly (also before this report is due).
