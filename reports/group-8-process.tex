\section{Introduction}
This document is the Process Report for the Group SD-8P (Group 8). It includes an overview of how the group is structured, how it communicated and how it formulated plans for this particular group project. Throughout the report we will use the terms team to refer to Team D (composed of Group 7 and 8), group (to refer to either Group 7 or 8) and subgroup (to refer to the smaller groups that were formed around certain tasks within each group).

\section{Conclusion}
In face of such a large task the group has kept itself on track in an organized, and relaxed, fashion. Expectations were high for the first friendly, but due to several different factors the robot did not perform as expected. We are currently awaiting to see the results for the second friendly (also before this report is due).
